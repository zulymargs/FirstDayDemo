# Student Do: Division Testing

Starter code: [./starter](./starter)

Solved code: [./solved](./solved)

In this activity, you will create test cases for the division operation of a calculator.

## Instructions

Work in pairs to complete the following goals:

- Create a class called `Calculator`.

- In the class, create a method called `divide` that takes two integers.

- The method `divide` should return the integer that results from dividing the two integers.

- It should return `0` if the numerator or denominator is `0`.

  > **Note:** Technically it is not possible to divide by 0, but we are keeping things simple for the purpose of the activity.

- Write unit tests to test your `divide` method.
